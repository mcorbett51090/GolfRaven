# P3 money path — requirements for the API / Edge Function layer

Source: the money-path security review of `packages/rules`, 2026-09-24.

`scorePlay` is a pure function, and it is only as trustworthy as its input. The package now fixes what a pure
function can fix: allow-list checks, a strict input parser, a course anchor, and caps. Everything below can only
be enforced where the input is built. Each item must be satisfied, and tested, before the P3 Edge Functions ship.
The DB-side items are tracked in the P3a queue.

## 1. Build every `Evidence` / `AppFix` on the server — never pass client JSON through

| Field | Must come from |
|---|---|
| `token.grade`, `hardwareSupportsAttestation` | Server verification of App Attest / Play Integrity, and the verified device model |
| `challenge` | The `checkin_challenge` row: single-use, `used_at` set atomically |
| `facilityId`, `verificationTier`, `geometryKind`, `insideBuffer`, `accuracyMeters` | Re-running the matcher (`packages/matching`) on the raw coordinates against the signed catalog |
| `capturedAt` | For live challenges, clamped to `[challenge.issued_at, issued_at + TTL]`. Otherwise a skew check against server `now`, with a `fraud_signal` above 24 h |
| `localDate` | Derived from the server-trusted `capturedAt` and the facility `tz` |
| `fixId` | The challenge id, or a hash of the attestation assertion |

## 2. Each row type comes only from its own server path

| Row / field | Only from |
|---|---|
| `staff_presence` (`scanAt` = server time) | `/v1/partner/attest`, with an `attestation` row carrying a unique `token_jti` |
| `booking`, `paymentRef` | The P7 provider webhook |
| `arccos` / `garmin` (`vendorCourseMapped`, `sensorProvenance`) | The P8 connector |
| Receipt `status` | The review queue |
| `courseDisambiguatedBy` | The matcher or the portal |

`POST /v1/evidence` rejects every field in these two tables.

## 3. Per-play limits and fraud signals

- Cap evidence rows at 200 per play. Catch scorer exceptions per play, so one bad row cannot block a
  re-score batch.
- Event-time velocity check: a play is disputed above 200 km/h between consecutive fixes.
- Clock skew over 24 h → `fraud_signal`.
- A fix that grades `failed` → `fraud_signal(attestation_failed)`. The scorer only zeroes that fix.

## 4. Persisting and issuing

- Store the scorer's own `money`, `heldReview`, `hardSignal`, `policyVersion` and `inputDigest`.
- Never recompute money from the rounded `numeric(3,2)` score.
- Reserve offer budget atomically (row lock). Validate eligibility at save, approval and issuance with
  `validateOfferEligibility`. That validator rejects rules that are true on an empty play set. Treat a thrown
  validator error as invalid.

## Status

| Item | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1, 2, 3, 4 | P3 Edge Functions | Not started (P3 Edge Functions are not built yet) |
| `play_evidence UNIQUE(evidence_id)`, grade column, budget CHECKs, decision columns, receipt dedupe, global nonces | P3a migrations | Done — `supabase/migrations/0017_money_path_hardening.sql` |
| Allow-lists, parser, trust table, course anchor, caps, tautology rejection | `packages/rules` | In progress |

## Addendum (post-P3a gate): `evidence.attestation_grade` — "never graded" vs "unattestable"

`app.evidence.attestation_grade app.attestation_grade NOT NULL DEFAULT 'unattestable'`
(0017) reuses the existing three-value enum from 0003 (`'attested'`, `'unattestable'`,
`'failed'`). That enum has no fourth, "not yet graded" value, so every row defaults to
`'unattestable'` at INSERT time whether it was genuinely graded unattestable by server
verification (§1 above — the matcher/scorer ran and found no attestable signal) or has
simply never been graded at all (the P3 Edge Functions that would grade it don't exist
yet, per the Status table above).

**Decision (documented here per the gate's own instruction — "if adding it is
disruptive, document it" — rather than widening the enum now):** adding a fourth enum
value (`'pending'` or similar) is deferred to when the scoring Edge Function is actually
built, for two reasons:

1. `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` cannot run inside the same transaction as other DDL that
   uses the new value (a hard Postgres restriction, not a style choice), so it would
   force `0017_money_path_hardening.sql` to split into two migrations for one column —
   disproportionate for a value nothing yet reads or writes.
2. Nothing in this stage (P3a: schema + RLS only, no Edge Functions) actually
   DISTINGUISHES "never graded" from "graded unattestable" — the distinction only
   matters once a grading process exists to eventually revisit "never graded" rows and
   promote them, which is exactly the P3 Edge Function work the Status table already
   marks "Not started".

**Requirement carried forward, not dropped:** `attestation_grade` MUST be written from
server-side verification only (never client-supplied) — this is now stated on the
column itself (`COMMENT ON COLUMN`, 0017) so it survives independently of this doc. When
the P3 scoring Edge Function is built, add the enum's fourth value in its own migration,
backfill existing `'unattestable'` rows only where they are KNOWN never-graded (not
by assumption), and update `packages/rules`' consumers of this column accordingly.
